# malPatternEvaluator
A CLI tool to evaluate structural patterns derived from the MITRE ATT&CK framework on coreLang models using the Neo4j graph database. 
The pattern collection consists of 25 different patterns capable of identifying specific components in a model where structural defenses can be applied. In total 14 unique structural defenses are proposed that can alter the available attack paths generated in an attack graph.

## Installment
1. git clone https://github.com/JensEk/malPatternEvaluator.git
2. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Install Neo4j Desktop:
   - https://neo4j.com/docs/desktop-manual/current/
5. Connect to Neo4j desktop instance:
     uri="bolt://localhost:7687",
     username="neo4j",
     password="dynp12345!",
     dbname="neo4j",

## Usage
1. Compile coreLang model using the MAL-Toolbox or use the example models provided in the /models directory
2. python3 mpe.py -m models/mX/model_X.json -p patterns.json
3. CLI instructions:
     
   [1] *Analyze patterns* - Process each pattern from the pattern.json file and send the queries to the Neo4j graph database  
   [2] *Review Pattern Report* - Print the generated log report from the analyzed patterns  
   [3] *Apply mitigation* - From the pattern report select the ID of the pattern that should be mitigated and provide it as argument  
   [4] *Restore model* - Undo any changes to the provided model and restore it to its original state  
   [5] *Exit* - Terminates the program

## Pattern collection
Each pattern consists of two sub-patterns (BadPattern & MitigationPattern) that are encoded into Cypher queries that can be processed by the Neo4j graph database. The *BadPattern* blueprint identifies the components that may pose a threat and the *MitigationPattern* blueprint propose the structural changes.
To provide additional security guidance, a mapping has been made from each pattern to a selection of ATT&CK Technique and Mitigation IDs.
